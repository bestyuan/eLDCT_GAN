GAN network was used to process extra LDCT 

## Platform
The entire network was trained on an NVIDIA TITAN Xp GPU by using the tensorflow framework.  

## Requirements
python 3.6 tensorflow 1.13 and other common packages

## Network training 
We used a batch size of 4 and a training iteration number of 12k. An Adam algorithm with a learning rate of 0.02 was used.
